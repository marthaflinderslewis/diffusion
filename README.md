# Understanding Diffusion Models
This repo is a record of my efforts to understand diffusion models. I'm trying to code up a diffusion model not from scratch, but using only components that I (think) I understand. So far I have watch the first 37 minutes of this tutorial: https://cvpr2022-tutorial-diffusion-models.github.io/ which is very clear, although I have skipped over some of the details -- to be revisited!

At the moment (16/02/24) I don't understand UNet, so I am using an MLP for the noise prediction.
